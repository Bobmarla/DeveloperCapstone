  description: `Based in Chicago, Illinois, Little Lemon is a family-owned
   Mediterranean restaurant, 
  focused on traditional recipes served with a modern twist. 
  The chefs draw inspiration from Italian,
   Greek, and Turkish culture and have a menu of 12â€“15 items that they rotate seasonally. 
   The restaurant has a rustic and relaxed 
  atmosphere with moderate prices, 
  making it a popular place for a meal any 
  time of the day. Little Lemon is owned by 
  two Italian brothers, Mario and Adrian, 
  who moved to the United States to pursue their shared dream of owning a 
  restaurant. To craft the menu, Mario relies on family recipes and his experience 
  as a chef in Italy. Adrian does all the marketing for the restaurant and led the effort to 
    expand the menu beyond classic Italian to incorporate 
  additional cuisines from the Mediterranean region. `,
